# ðŸ“¡ NIDS Demo - Network Intrusion Detection System

This project is a demo web application for Network Intrusion Detection using a Random Forest classifier trained on synthetic CICIDS2017-inspired data. The app allows users to input network flow features, predict whether the flow is **Normal** or **Attack**, and see detailed prediction results.

## Features

- Predict network flow class (Normal vs. Attack) using a trained Random Forest model.
- Single input prediction via sidebar form.
- Batch prediction by uploading CSV files.
- Clean, interactive UI built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
- Lightweight, easy to run locally or deploy.
