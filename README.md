# ðŸ“¡ NIDS Demo - Network Intrusion Detection System

This project is a demo web application for Network Intrusion Detection using a Random Forest classifier trained on synthetic CICIDS2017-inspired data. The app allows users to input network flow features, predict whether the flow is **Normal** or **Attack**, and see detailed prediction results.
